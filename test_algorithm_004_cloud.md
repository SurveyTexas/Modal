## Algorithm Purpose
**Consistency Objective**: Ensure project identification details match EXACTLY everywhere across all project documents  
**Professional Stakes**: Project information inconsistencies create legal vulnerabilities and undermine document authenticity  
**Modal Validation**: Inconsistent project data questioned by courts, title companies, and professional reviewers  

## Implementation Framework

### EXHAUSTIVE VERIFICATION PROTOCOL
1. **Comprehensive Project Data Extraction**: Extract ALL project identifiers from ALL documents including title blocks, headers, footers, legal descriptions, and embedded references
2. **Information Format Analysis**: Establish authoritative version from primary legal source (deed, contract, or survey order)
3. **Cross-Document Character Verification**: Compare EVERY project reference character-by-character against established standard
4. **Authority-Based Resolution**: Apply William's office standards (5.0x authority) with legal documents as ultimate authority
5. **Comprehensive Correction Generation**: Document ALL non-compliant references with exact correction instructions

### Professional Examples
- **Standard Implementation**: "Smith Family Trust", "Project 2024-123", "Parcel ID: 45-67-890" must appear identically throughout all documents
- **High-Stakes Legal Context**: Client name variation between deed reference and survey title block creates title insurance claim requiring professional testimony and potential liability exposure

### Vision Integration
```yaml
discovers_patterns:
  - pattern_type: "consistency_critical"
    description: "Project naming formality patterns by client type"
    feeds_to_vision: true
consumes_patterns:
  - pattern_id: "VISION_2025_004"
    description: "Entity naming conventions and client preferences"
    application: "Adjusts formality level based on client sophistication"
pattern_priority: 1
```

### Evidence Documentation Requirements
**Inconsistency Report Format**:
- Location: [Document name, page number, section]
- Found: [Exact text as it appears]
- Expected: [Correct text per established standard]
- Impact: [Professional liability assessment]
- Correction: [Specific update instruction]

### Authority Application Matrix
- **Legal Documents**: Ultimate authority for client names, legal descriptions, parcel identifiers
- **William's Standards**: Project numbering format, professional presentation preferences
- **Regional Standards**: County-specific requirements via Russ's authority (4.9x)
- **Client Preferences**: Established through Modal's professional experience validation

### Usage Analytics Tracking
**Metrics to Capture**:
- Frequency of project information inconsistencies by document type
- Time required for complete project information verification
- Most common inconsistency patterns (abbreviations, punctuation, case sensitivity)
- Client types most prone to project identification errors
- Success rate of automated correction suggestions

### Performance Optimization Notes
**Cloud Loading Optimization**: This algorithm loads in under 2 seconds due to minimal dependencies and straightforward logic flow. Recommended for high-frequency algorithm group due to universal applicability across all survey types.

**Memory Footprint**: Minimal - primarily text comparison operations with small data structures for tracking inconsistencies.

**Scaling Considerations**: Performance remains consistent regardless of project complexity. Suitable for projects ranging from simple boundary surveys to complex subdivision plats with hundreds of lots.

### Professional Liability Protection
This algorithm specifically protects against professional liability by ensuring document consistency that withstands legal scrutiny. Inconsistent project identification has been cited in malpractice claims where document authenticity was questioned. By maintaining character-level consistency, this algorithm provides evidence of professional attention to detail that supports credibility in legal proceedings.

### Integration with Survey Types
- **Boundary Surveys**: Verifies property owner names, legal descriptions, parcel numbers
- **ALTA Surveys**: Critical for title insurance acceptance - ANY inconsistency delays closing
- **Topographic Surveys**: Ensures project identification consistency across multiple sheet sets
- **Subdivision Plats**: Verifies developer names, subdivision names, phase identifications
- **Route Surveys**: Maintains consistency in project identification across linear project segments
